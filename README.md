ðŸ§  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier â€“ AI & ML Internship (Task)

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification as part of the AI & ML Internship program.


---

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To understand and implement the KNN algorithm for classification, explore the impact of different values of K, evaluate model performance, and visually interpret decision boundaries.


---

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas / NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn



---

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

You may use any classification dataset such as:

Iris Dataset (commonly used for KNN tasks)
ðŸ‘‰ Download Dataset
(or load directly via sklearn.datasets.load_iris)



---

ðŸš€ Steps Performed

1. Select and load a dataset (e.g., Iris).


2. Normalize/Standardize features for better performance.


3. Train a KNN Classifier using KNeighborsClassifier from Scikit-learn.


4. Experiment with different values of K to observe accuracy variations.


5. Evaluate performance using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix



6. Visualize decision boundaries for better interpretation.

ðŸ“Š Results & Observations

Lower values of K may lead to overfitting, while higher values may oversmooth decision regions.

Optimal K value found through experimentation or cross-validation.

Decision boundary plots help understand model behavior visually.
